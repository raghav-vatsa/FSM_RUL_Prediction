The programs in this data has been created to make a prediction model using both Machine learning and Deep Learning to predict the remaining useful life of Turbofans under my summer internship in 2021 at FSM labs. Being able to predict the remaining useful life of machines is the most important aspect of predictive maintenance which comes under the banner of Industrial Internet of Things or Industry 4.0 and has proven to show great improvement in effectivity of manufacturing plants by decreasing the down time of machines and giving industrialists ample of time to prevent a machine from breaking down during operations.
